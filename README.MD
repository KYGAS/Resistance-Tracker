# Resistance-Tracker
Lets you see true resistance of bosses against you.

## Info
- You have to manually add the opcodes and the definition to their places in Toolbox.
- They are server opcode and definition so you are 100% safe as long as you don't stream or record videos since this change is visible to people that can do math.

## Usage
### `/8 resistances`
- Enables/disables resistance-tracker
- Default is on

## Issues
- It's a very TESTABLE module. Idk if it works all the time. DM : KYGAS#8575 for bugs <3
